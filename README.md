# loveOmeter
rework of project 03 from the arduino starter kit


ok so the first thing your going to want to do is add another 6 leds

i use 3 red 3 yellow and 3 green
red pins 2, 3, 4
yellow pins 5,6,7
green pins 8, 9, 10

ultimatly my plan here is to turn this thing into a digital thermometer and shoot the output into my rasberry pi where it will be stored
and analized againced other crap im testing and sending to the raspberry pi

eventualy i want to take all the random junk i have laying around and turn it into a weather predicting machine 
(far cry from the love o meter project o3)
